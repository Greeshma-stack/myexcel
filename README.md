Interactive Employee Attendance Dashboard

This Excel workbook provides an interactive dashboard for analyzing annual employee attendance data from 2025, using pivot tables, slicers, and charts to visualize attendance trends, absenteeism rates, and departmental summaries

Key Features:

Slicers for filtering by employee name, department, month, or attendance status.

Pivot charts displaying monthly attendance percentages, top absentees, and present days summary.

Conditional formatting and automated formulas highlighting late arrivals, leaves, and perfect attendance records.

How to Use:

Open annual_employee_attendance_2025.xlsx in Microsoft Excel (2016 or later). Enable macros and refresh all pivot tables (Data > Refresh All) on first load. Interact with slicers on the Dashboard sheet to filter views—charts and tables update dynamically

Data Overview:

Dataset covers employee attendance for 2025 with columns including Employee ID, Name, Department, Date, Status (P/Present, A/Absent, L/Leave, etc.), and hours worked. Raw data resides in the "AttendanceData" sheet; dashboard pulls from this via pivots for real-time analysis

Technologies:

Excel PivotTables, PivotCharts, and Slicers for interactivity.

Formulas like COUNTIFS for metrics (e.g., attendance rate = Present days / Total working days).

Conditional formatting for visual status indicators.
